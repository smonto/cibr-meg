How to create model-based sets of cortical ROIs?

You need:
 - these Matlab functions
 - MNE-C and MNE-Matlab tools (M. Hämäläinen et al.)
 - prepared forward and inverse operators in FIFF-format
 
Basically, you only need to run the linkage_parcellation.m function. Asking "help" from Matlab will reveal the parameters you need.
You can tweak some additional parameters by editing some definitions in the function:
 - set the FreeSurfer directory (FS_dir) if not defined by $SUBJECTS_DIR
 - set the FreeSurfer anatomical parcellation, which can be used to confine ROIs
 - discard invisible sources based on forward model (separately for sensor types: maglim, gradlim, eeglim)
