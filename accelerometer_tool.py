# Script for reading accelerometer data,
# plotting the data,
# combining individual channels to net acceleration,
# thresholding net acceleration for triggering

# read the MEG data

# pick acc channels

# plot x,y,z

# rms directions

# make a trigger channels

# write additional channel to FIFF or integrate into STI101?
